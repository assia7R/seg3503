I decided to develop the fizzbuzz project. In Fizzbuzz_java, I have the Fizzbuzz.java class within the src folder, and the FizzbuzzTest.java within the folder test.
At the begining I made 5 tests I run them in vsc and the all failed here's an image

I made them fail at the beginning then changed them and made them pass, every test check one of the conditions for example the first one to check if it is a Fizz
the second Buzz, third i checked if a certain number n here i chose 7, the fourth one i checked the fonction FizzbuzzE, for the fifth one i checked if it's fizzbuzz.
